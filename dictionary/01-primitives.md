# Level 1: Primitives

The irreducible atoms of visual composition.

---

## Overview

Every composition is built from five primitives. Each can be described through three lenses:

| Geometric | Perceptual | Energetic |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| What it *is* | How we *see* it | What it *does* |

---

## 1.1 Point / Mark / Seed

### Definition

| Lens | Term | Definition |
|------|------|------------|
| Geometric | **Point** | A position without dimension; the smallest locatable unit |
| Perceptual | **Mark** | The first disturbance of empty space; something to notice |
| Energetic | **Seed** | Concentrated potential; origin of forces |

### Inherent Properties

- **Demands attention** — creates focus
- **Implies stillness** — unless multiplied
- **Has no direction** — but has position

### Character by Quantity

| Count | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| One | Focus, singularity, loneliness |
| Two | Relationship, tension, dialogue |
| Three | Pattern begins, stability, group |
| Many | Texture, field, dissolution of individual |

### Character by Placement

| Position | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Center | Stability, importance, target |
| Off-center | Tension, movement, interest |
| Edge | Precariousness, transition |
| Corner | Compression, trap |

> "The geometric point is the ultimate and most singular union of silence and speech."  
> — Kandinsky

## 1.2 Line / Path / Force

### Definition

| Lens | Term | Definition |
|------|------|------------|
| Geometric | **Line** | Extension in one dimension; connection of two points |
| Perceptual | **Path** | A trajectory for the eye; something to follow |
| Energetic | **Force** | Directed energy; tension with direction |

### Inherent Properties

- **Creates direction** — leads somewhere
- **Implies movement** — frozen motion
- **Divides space** — creates "sides"

### Character by Orientation

| Type | Visual | Feeling |
|------|--------|---------|
| Horizontal | — | Calm, rest, landscape, death |
| Vertical | \| | Alert, growth, portrait, life |
| Diagonal ↗ | / | Optimism, effort, rising |
| Diagonal ↘ | \ | Decline, ease, falling |
| Curved | ~ | Organic, flowing, gentle |
| Broken | - - - | Fragmented, uncertain, nervous |

### Character by Quality

| Quality | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Thick | Heavy, bold, assertive |
| Thin | Delicate, precise, quiet |
| Sharp | Clean, mechanical, certain |
| Rough | Organic, textured, emotional |

## 1.3 Plane / Field / Ground

### Definition

| Lens | Term | Definition |
|------|------|------------|
| Geometric | **Plane** | Extension in two dimensions; bounded area |
| Perceptual | **Field** | A zone of visual activity; area of belonging |
| Energetic | **Ground** | Foundation; space that holds or resists |

### Inherent Properties

- **Has shape** — boundary defines character
- **Contains or excludes** — creates inside/outside
- **Has weight** — area implies mass

### Character by Shape

| Shape | Feeling |
|-------|---------|
| Circle/Oval | Organic, complete, soft, eternal |
| Square | Stable, artificial, grounded, rational |
| Rectangle | Directional, framing, narrative |
| Triangle | Dynamic, pointed, hierarchical |
| Irregular | Organic, chaotic, natural, emotional |

### Character by Boundary

| Boundary | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Hard edge | Defined, certain, confrontational |
| Soft edge | Approachable, transitional, gentle |
| Dissolved | Ambiguous, merging, mysterious |
| Absent | Infinite, atmospheric, unbounded |

## 1.4 Volume / Body / Container

### Definition

| Lens | Term | Definition |
|------|------|------------|
| Geometric | **Volume** | Extension in three dimensions; implied or actual depth |
| Perceptual | **Body** | A presence; something with substance |
| Energetic | **Container** | Enclosed space; holds or protects |

### Inherent Properties

- **Occupies space** — displaces emptiness
- **Has surface** — interface with surroundings
- **Creates interior** — hidden space

### Character by Form

| Form | Feeling |
|------|---------|
| Sphere | Complete, perfect, celestial |
| Cube | Stable, rational, architectural |
| Cylinder | Organic yet ordered, growth |
| Pyramid | Hierarchical, ancient, aspirational |
| Irregular | Natural, chaotic, alive |

---

## 1.5 Void / Emptiness / Potential

### Definition

| Lens | Term | Definition |
|------|------|------------|
| Geometric | **Void** | Absence of elements; negative space |
| Perceptual | **Emptiness** | Rest for the eye; breathing room |
| Energetic | **Potential** | Unrealized energy; space waiting to be activated |

### Inherent Properties

- **Defines by absence** — shapes what surrounds it
- **Creates contrast** — makes presence visible
- **Implies possibility** — something could happen here

### Character by Proportion

| Ratio (void:content) | Effect |
|----------------------|--------|
| Dominant void | Isolation, focus, contemplation, breathing |
| Equal | Balance, dialogue, partnership |
| Minimal void | Density, intensity, claustrophobia |
| No void | Overwhelm, chaos, horror vacui |

### Active vs Passive Void

| Type | Description | Effect |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Active void** | Shaped by surrounding elements | Part of composition, holds tension |
| **Passive void** | Leftover space | Background, unremarkable |

> The void is not nothing. It is the space that makes something possible.

## Primitive Interactions

When primitives combine, new properties emerge:

| Combination | Creates |
|-------------|---------|
| Point + Point | Relationship, implied line |
| Point + Line | Emphasis, intersection, anchor |
| Line + Line | Angle, grid, intersection |
| Line + Plane | Division, boundary, penetration |
| Plane + Plane | Layer, overlap, transparency |
| Any + Void | Figure/ground, isolation, breath |

---

## Practice

### Exercise 1: Identify

Look at any image. What primitives do you see?
- Where are the points (marks, seeds)?
- Where are the lines (paths, forces)?
- Where are the planes (fields, grounds)?
- Where is the void (emptiness, potential)?

### Exercise 2: Reduce

Take a complex image. Reduce it to only its primitives.
Draw just the essential points, lines, and planes.
What remains? What is lost?

### Exercise 3: Generate

Using only one primitive type, create three compositions:
1. Calm
2. Tense
3. Dynamic

What properties did you change to create different feelings?
