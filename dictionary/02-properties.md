# Level 2: Properties

Attributes that modify primitives.

---

## Overview

Properties are the adjectives of composition. They describe *how* a primitive exists — its position, scale, character, and energy.

Each property exists on a scale. Compositions gain interest by varying properties across elements.

## 2.1 Spatial Properties

### Position

Where an element lives within the frame.

| Value | Description | Creates |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Center** | Equidistant from edges | Stability, importance, target |
| **Off-center** | Displaced from center | Dynamic balance, interest, tension |
| **Edge** | Along frame boundary | Transition, precariousness, liminality |
| **Corner** | Intersection of two edges | Compression, trap, maximum tension |
| **Outside** | Beyond frame boundary | Escape, continuation, mystery |

```
Scale: center ←――――→ off-center ←――――→ edge ←――――→ corner ←――――→ outside
```

**Rule of thumb:** Distance from center increases tension.

---

### Scale

Relative size of elements.

| Value | Description | Creates |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Dominant** | Largest relative size | Power, importance, loudness |
| **Subordinate** | Smaller relative size | Support, quiet, deference |
| **Equal** | Same relative size | Balance, democracy, repetition |
| **Overwhelming** | Fills/exceeds frame | Immersion, claustrophobia, awe |
| **Minimal** | Nearly invisible | Vulnerability, preciousness, whisper |

```
Scale: overwhelming ←――――→ dominant ←――――→ equal ←――――→ subordinate ←――――→ minimal
```

**Rule of thumb:** Scale difference creates hierarchy. Equal scale creates pattern.

---

### Orientation

Angular relationship to the frame.

| Value | Description | Creates |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Horizontal** | Parallel to horizon | Calm, rest, stability, death |
| **Vertical** | Perpendicular to horizon | Alert, growth, life, aspiration |
| **Diagonal ↗** | Rising left to right | Optimism, effort, progress |
| **Diagonal ↘** | Falling left to right | Decline, ease, entropy |
| **Tilted** | Off true axis | Instability, dynamism, unease |

```
Calm ←―― horizontal ―― vertical ―― diagonal ――→ Tense
```

**Cultural note:** Reading direction affects diagonal perception. In left-to-right cultures, ↗ feels like rising, ↘ like falling.

---

### Depth

Position in implied z-space.

| Value | Description | Creates |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Foreground** | Closest to viewer | Immediate, present, confrontational |
| **Middleground** | Intermediate distance | Context, narrative, journey |
| **Background** | Farthest from viewer | Past, memory, environment |
| **Flat** | No depth cues | Abstract, graphic, timeless |
| **Deep** | Strong depth cues | Immersive, spatial, inviting |

```
Abstract ←―― flat ―― shallow ―― moderate ―― deep ――→ Immersive
```

---

## 2.2 Visual Properties

### Density

How much space an element fills.

| Value | Description | Creates |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Solid** | Completely filled | Heavy, certain, opaque |
| **Dense** | Tightly packed | Intense, crowded, active |
| **Moderate** | Balanced fill | Comfortable, readable |
| **Sparse** | Widely distributed | Quiet, isolated, contemplative |
| **Empty** | Nothing present | Void, potential, silence |

```
Scale: solid ←――――→ dense ←――――→ moderate ←――――→ sparse ←――――→ empty
```

---

### Contrast

Degree of difference (in value, color, scale, etc.).

| Value | Description | Creates |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Extreme** | Maximum difference | Drama, conflict, clarity |
| **High** | Strong difference | Energy, distinction, boldness |
| **Moderate** | Noticeable difference | Comfortable, readable |
| **Low** | Subtle difference | Soft, unified, calm |
| **None** | No difference | Invisible, merged, lost |

```
Scale: extreme ←――――→ high ←――――→ moderate ←――――→ low ←――――→ none
```

**Rule of thumb:** Contrast directs attention. Highest contrast = focal point.

---

### Boundary

Edge quality between element and surroundings.

| Value | Description | Creates |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Hard** | Sharp, defined edge | Certainty, separation, confrontation |
| **Firm** | Clear but not harsh | Definition, clarity |
| **Soft** | Gradual transition | Approachability, gentleness |
| **Blurred** | Ambiguous edge | Mystery, transition, movement |
| **Dissolved** | No clear edge | Merging, atmosphere, dissolution |

```
Scale: hard ←――――→ firm ←――――→ soft ←――――→ blurred ←――――→ dissolved
```

---

### Texture

Surface quality.

| Value | Description | Creates |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Smooth** | No surface variation | Calm, artificial, perfect |
| **Fine** | Small-scale variation | Delicate, detailed, organic |
| **Coarse** | Large-scale variation | Rough, natural, tactile |
| **Uniform** | Consistent texture | Order, manufactured |
| **Varied** | Changing texture | Natural, complex, rich |

---

## 2.3 Energetic Properties

### Weight

Visual heaviness.

| Value | Description | Creates |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Heavy** | Visually massive | Grounded, serious, immovable |
| **Substantial** | Noticeable mass | Present, solid, reliable |
| **Balanced** | Neither heavy nor light | Neutral, flexible |
| **Light** | Visually minimal mass | Airy, free, ephemeral |
| **Weightless** | No apparent mass | Floating, spiritual, transcendent |

```
Scale: heavy ←――――→ substantial ←――――→ balanced ←――――→ light ←――――→ weightless
```

**What creates visual weight:**
- Dark value → heavy
- Large size → heavy
- Texture → heavy
- Lower position → heavy
- Dense pattern → heavy
- Warm color → heavier than cool

---

### Temperature

Psychological warmth/coolness.

| Value | Description | Creates |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Hot** | Advancing, aggressive | Passion, danger, urgency |
| **Warm** | Inviting, comfortable | Intimacy, welcome, life |
| **Neutral** | Neither warm nor cool | Balance, objectivity |
| **Cool** | Receding, calm | Distance, peace, intellect |
| **Cold** | Remote, uninviting | Isolation, death, sterility |

```
Scale: hot ←――――→ warm ←――――→ neutral ←――――→ cool ←――――→ cold
```

---

### Tension

Degree of strain or opposition.

| Value | Description | Creates |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Extreme** | Maximum strain | Crisis, breaking point |
| **High** | Strong opposition | Drama, conflict, energy |
| **Moderate** | Some strain | Interest, engagement |
| **Low** | Little opposition | Calm, resolution |
| **Resolved** | No strain | Peace, completion, stasis |

```
Scale: extreme ←――――→ high ←――――→ moderate ←――――→ low ←――――→ resolved
```

**What creates tension:**
- Diagonal orientation
- High contrast
- Edge/corner position
- Asymmetric balance
- Opposing forces
- Compressed space

---

### Movement

Implied motion.

| Value | Description | Creates |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Static** | No implied motion | Stability, permanence, death |
| **Potential** | Motion about to happen | Anticipation, suspense |
| **Slow** | Gentle implied motion | Calm, meditation, flow |
| **Fast** | Rapid implied motion | Energy, urgency, chaos |
| **Frozen** | Captured mid-motion | Dramatic, suspended, tense |

```
Scale: static ←――――→ potential ←――――→ slow ←――――→ fast ←――――→ frozen
```

**What creates implied movement:**
- Diagonal lines (direction of motion)
- Repeated elements with variation (sequence)
- Blur or dissolution (speed)
- Asymmetric balance (about to tip)
- Cut-off elements (continuing beyond frame)

## Property Combinations

## Practice

### Exercise 1: Property Scales

Take one element. Create a series showing it moving through one property scale:
- Position: center → edge → corner → outside
- Contrast: none → low → moderate → high → extreme
- Boundary: hard → firm → soft → blurred → dissolved

### Exercise 2: Combinations

Choose two properties. Create a 3×3 grid showing their interaction:
- Rows: property A (low, medium, high)
- Columns: property B (low, medium, high)

What happens at each intersection?

### Exercise 3: Prediction

Before creating an image, write down its properties. After creating it, compare. Did the feeling match your prediction?
