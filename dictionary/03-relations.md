# Level 3: Relations

How elements interact with each other, the frame, and the viewer.

---

## Overview

Relations are the verbs of composition. They describe what happens *between* things — the forces, connections, and dialogues that create meaning.

An element alone has properties. Elements together have relations.

## 3.1 Relations Between Elements

### Proximity Relations

How close elements are to each other.

| Relation | Description | Creates |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Touching** | Elements share edge or overlap | Unity, merger, interaction |
| **Near** | Close but separate | Association, dialogue, tension |
| **Moderate** | Comfortable distance | Independence with connection |
| **Far** | Significant separation | Isolation, loneliness, independence |
| **Opposite** | Maximum distance within frame | Polarity, confrontation, balance |

```
Unity ←―― touching ―― near ―― moderate ―― far ―― opposite ――→ Polarity
```

**Gestalt principle:** Elements near each other are perceived as a group.

### Force Relations

Implied physical interaction between elements.

| Relation | Description | Creates |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Attraction** | Elements appear to pull toward each other | Connection, desire, inevitability |
| **Repulsion** | Elements appear to push apart | Conflict, rejection, explosion |
| **Orbit** | One element circles another | Hierarchy, protection, relationship |
| **Collision** | Elements on impact course | Drama, violence, energy |
| **Parallel** | Elements moving same direction | Agreement, harmony, flow |
| **Convergence** | Elements moving toward same point | Focus, destiny, gathering |
| **Divergence** | Elements moving apart | Separation, dispersal, choice |

**What creates force relations:**
- Direction implied by shape
- Spatial proximity
- Size relationship
- Eye line / facing direction
- Color/value gradient

---

### Hierarchy Relations

Power relationships between elements.

| Relation | Description | Creates |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Dominance** | One element clearly primary | Focus, importance, narrative |
| **Subordination** | One element clearly secondary | Support, context, depth |
| **Equality** | Elements of same visual importance | Balance, democracy, pattern |
| **Sequence** | Elements in ordered progression | Time, narrative, rhythm |
| **Cluster** | Elements grouped together | Unity, mass, family |

**What creates hierarchy:**
- Scale difference
- Position (center > edge > corner)
- Contrast (high contrast = dominant)
- Isolation (alone = important)
- Detail (more detail = more attention)

---

### Echo Relations

How elements repeat, vary, or contrast.

| Relation | Description | Creates |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Repetition** | Same element multiple times | Rhythm, pattern, emphasis |
| **Variation** | Similar but different elements | Unity with interest, development |
| **Contrast** | Opposite elements | Drama, distinction, meaning |
| **Rhyme** | Different elements with shared quality | Subtle unity, sophistication |
| **Counterpoint** | Independent but complementary | Complexity, richness, dialogue |

**Examples of rhyme:**
- Different shapes, same color
- Different sizes, same position relative to edge
- Different textures, same value

---

### Dialogue Relations

How elements "communicate" visually.

| Relation | Description | Creates |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Facing** | Elements oriented toward each other | Conversation, confrontation |
| **Turning away** | Elements oriented apart | Ignoring, independence, tension |
| **Looking at same thing** | Shared orientation | Unity of attention, narrative |
| **Mirroring** | Reflected forms | Symmetry, duality, response |
| **Call and response** | Different but related forms | Dialogue, development |

---

## 3.2 Relations Between Element and Frame

### Position Relations

How elements relate to the frame's geometry.

| Relation | Description | Creates |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Centered** | Element at frame center | Stability, importance, formality |
| **Floating** | Element unanchored to edges | Freedom, isolation, suspense |
| **Anchored** | Element touching/near edge | Stability, grounding, connection |
| **Cropped** | Element extends beyond frame | Continuation, immersion, intimacy |
| **Cornered** | Element in corner | Compression, trap, marginality |

---

### Space Relations

How elements distribute within the frame.

| Relation | Description | Creates |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Fills frame** | Element occupies most space | Dominance, claustrophobia, immersion |
| **Surrounded by void** | Element isolated in space | Focus, loneliness, importance |
| **Balanced distribution** | Even use of space | Harmony, completeness |
| **Asymmetric distribution** | Uneven use of space | Dynamic, tension, interest |
| **Clustered** | Elements grouped, rest empty | Focal area vs. rest, narrative |

**Visual weight balance:**
- Large element near center = small element at edge
- Dark element near center = light element at edge
- Complex element near center = simple element at edge

---

### Edge Relations

How elements interact with frame boundaries.

| Relation | Description | Creates |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Entry** | Element appears to enter frame | Arrival, beginning, intrusion |
| **Exit** | Element appears to leave frame | Departure, ending, escape |
| **Trapped** | Element contained by frame | Confinement, safety, limitation |
| **Escaping** | Element breaking free of frame | Liberation, expansion, power |
| **Parallel to edge** | Element echoes frame boundary | Stability, formality, order |
| **Perpendicular to edge** | Element opposes frame boundary | Tension, confrontation |

---

### Frame as Element

The frame itself is a compositional element.

| Frame character | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| Square | Stable, neutral, non-directional |
| Horizontal rectangle | Landscape, panorama, journey |
| Vertical rectangle | Portrait, height, aspiration |
| Circle | Complete, focused, eternal |
| Irregular | Dynamic, organic, unconventional |

**Frame tension:** Elements parallel to frame edges = calm. Elements diagonal to frame edges = tense.

---

## 3.3 Relations Between Element and Viewer

### Address Relations

How elements relate to viewer's position.

| Relation | Description | Creates |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct** | Element faces viewer | Confrontation, connection, engagement |
| **Indirect** | Element turned away | Privacy, mystery, narrative |
| **Profile** | Element perpendicular to viewer | Distance, objectivity, presentation |
| **Oblique** | Element at angle to viewer | Dynamism, casual, spontaneity |

---

### Distance Relations

Implied psychological distance to viewer.

| Relation | Description | Creates |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Intimate** | Very close to viewer | Personal, intrusive, overwhelming |
| **Personal** | Close, comfortable | Friendly, approachable |
| **Social** | Moderate distance | Formal, objective |
| **Public** | Far from viewer | Distant, overview, context |
| **Infinite** | Extreme distance | Cosmic, insignificant, transcendent |

**What creates distance:**
- Scale of main element
- Depth of space
- Level of detail visible
- Cropping (tight = intimate)

---

### Gaze Relations

Where attention is directed.

| Relation | Description | Creates |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Viewer included** | Element looks at viewer | Connection, fourth wall break |
| **Viewer excluded** | Element looks elsewhere | Voyeurism, narrative, independence |
| **Shared gaze** | Viewer and element look at same thing | Unity, direction, story |
| **Competing gazes** | Multiple directions pull attention | Confusion, complexity, choice |

---

## 3.4 Compound Relations

Relations can stack and interact.

### Tension Compounds

| Combination | Creates |
|-------------|---------|
| Near + Repulsion | Uncomfortable closeness |
| Far + Attraction | Longing, unreachable |
| Equality + Contrast | Balanced opposition |
| Dominant + Edge | Power marginalized |
| Cropped + Exit | Active departure |

### Harmony Compounds

| Combination | Creates |
|-------------|---------|
| Near + Attraction | Natural closeness |
| Equal + Parallel | Unified movement |
| Centered + Surrounded | Focused importance |
| Echo + Variation | Unity with interest |
| Facing + Moderate | Comfortable dialogue |

## Relation Interactions

### Force Diagrams

Every composition has an underlying force diagram. Sketch the:
- Directions elements imply
- Attractions between elements
- Boundaries and resistances
- Path the eye follows

This reveals the composition's energy.

### Balance Points

In any composition:
- Where is visual weight concentrated?
- Where is the fulcrum (balance point)?
- Is balance symmetric or asymmetric?
- Is balance stable or precarious?

---

## Quick Reference

### Creating Connection

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| Proximity | Extreme distance |
| Facing | Turning away |
| Shared gaze | Competing gazes |
| Echo/rhyme | Unrelated forms |
| Parallel movement | Divergent movement |

### Creating Tension

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| Near + Repulsion | Near + Attraction |
| Asymmetric balance | Symmetric balance |
| Competing forces | Unified forces |
| Edge/corner position | Center position |
| Collision course | Parallel paths |

### Creating Focus

| Use | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| Isolation | Element alone = important |
| Scale dominance | Largest = most important |
| Contrast | Highest contrast = focal point |
| Convergence | Lines point to focus |
| Centered position | Center = important |

---

## Practice

### Exercise 1: Force Diagrams

Take three compositions you like. Draw only:
- Arrows showing implied direction
- Lines showing attractions/repulsions
- Dots showing focal points

Compare the underlying forces.

### Exercise 2: Rebalancing

Take a balanced composition. Move one element. What happens to the balance? How could you restore it?

### Exercise 3: Relation Swap

Take a composition. Keep the elements but change one relation:
- Attraction → Repulsion
- Facing → Turning away
- Centered → Cornered

How does the feeling change?
