# Level 4: Patterns

Formulas that combine elements, properties, and relations to create specific effects.

---

## Overview

Patterns are the sentences of composition grammar. They combine primitives, properties, and relations into recognizable structures that create predictable feelings.

**Format:**
```
elements + properties + relations → feeling
```

These are not rules to follow — they're patterns to recognize, use, invert, and combine.

---

## 4.1 Focus Patterns

Patterns that direct attention.

---

### Isolation Focus

```
single_element + center_position + surrounding_void + high_contrast
→ Creates: importance, attention, preciousness, solitude
```

**Why it works:** Nothing competes. The eye has nowhere else to go. The void gives the element room to breathe and be seen.

**Variations:**
- Off-center isolation: adds tension, dynamism
- Low-contrast isolation: creates subtlety, requires discovery
- Multiple isolated elements: creates dialogue, comparison

**Inversion:** Fill the frame completely = overwhelm, chaos, no single focus

---

### Scale Focus

```
dominant_element + subordinate_elements + proximity
→ Creates: hierarchy, narrative center, importance
```

**Why it works:** Visual weight demands attention. Smaller elements become context for the large one.

**Variations:**
- Extreme scale difference: drama, surrealism
- Subtle scale difference: sophistication, subtlety
- Inverse scale (important thing is small): vulnerability, precious

---

### Contrast Focus

```
differentiated_element + uniform_context + moderate_contrast
→ Creates: discovery, uniqueness, emergence
```

**Why it works:** The different thing stands out. Contrast is attention.

**Variations:**
- Color contrast in neutral field
- Sharp edge in soft field
- Static element in moving field
- Single diagonal in horizontal/vertical grid

---

### Convergence Focus

```
multiple_lines + single_intersection + directional_force
→ Creates: destiny, inevitability, target
```

**Why it works:** Lines lead the eye. All paths lead to one point.

**Variations:**
- Explicit convergence (actual lines)
- Implied convergence (alignment of separate elements)
- Partial convergence (lines approach but don't meet): tension, anticipation

---

## 4.2 Tension Patterns

Patterns that create strain, drama, conflict.

---

### Diagonal Drama

```
diagonal_orientation + high_contrast + asymmetric_position
→ Creates: instability, action, urgency, drama
```

**Why it works:** Diagonals fight gravity. Asymmetry resists resolution. High contrast amplifies everything.

**Variations:**
- Single diagonal: clear direction, movement
- Crossing diagonals: conflict, collision
- Diagonal approaching horizontal: decelerating, resolving
- Diagonal approaching vertical: accelerating, escalating

---

### Edge Tension

```
element + edge_proximity + cropping + direction_toward_exit
→ Creates: anxiety, escape, limitation, precariousness
```

**Why it works:** The edge is a boundary. Approaching it suggests leaving, ending, or being cut off.

**Variations:**
- Element entering frame: arrival, beginning
- Element exiting frame: departure, ending
- Element pressed against edge: trapped, constrained
- Element reaching beyond edge: expansion, liberation

---

### Opposition Tension

```
two_elements + maximum_distance + equal_weight + facing
→ Creates: confrontation, standoff, polarity, choice
```

**Why it works:** Equal forces don't resolve. The space between becomes charged.

**Variations:**
- Facing elements: direct conflict
- Back-to-back elements: mutual rejection, ignoring
- One larger than other: imbalanced conflict, inevitable winner
- Barrier between: separation, forbidden

---

### Compressed Tension

```
multiple_elements + corner_position + tight_proximity + hard_boundaries
→ Creates: claustrophobia, pressure, trap, explosion potential
```

**Why it works:** No escape. Forces push inward. Energy builds with nowhere to go.

**Variations:**
- Elements compressing toward center: implosion
- Elements compressing toward edge: expulsion
- Compression with one escape route: channeled release

---

### Suspended Tension

```
element + off_center + diagonal + frozen_movement
→ Creates: anticipation, held breath, potential energy
```

**Why it works:** Motion is implied but not completed. We wait for resolution.

**Variations:**
- Object about to fall: gravity tension
- Object mid-action: temporal suspension
- Object leaning: balance tension

---

## 4.3 Calm Patterns

Patterns that create peace, rest, stability.

---

### Horizontal Rest

```
horizontal_elements + center_vertical_position + low_contrast + soft_boundaries
→ Creates: peace, rest, stability, landscape
```

**Why it works:** Horizontal = lying down, at rest. Low contrast = no conflict. Soft edges = no threat.

**Variations:**
- Stacked horizontals: layered calm, depth
- Single horizon: simplicity, infinite
- Horizon + small vertical: calm with focus

---

### Symmetric Balance

```
mirrored_elements + vertical_axis + equal_weight + moderate_spacing
→ Creates: order, formality, completion, authority
```

**Why it works:** Perfect balance. No unresolved forces. Classical stability.

**Variations:**
- Exact mirror: formal, rigid
- Near-mirror with variation: sophisticated, alive
- Broken symmetry: tension within order

---

### Sparse Contemplation

```
minimal_elements + abundant_void + soft_contrast + floating_position
→ Creates: meditation, breath, openness, space
```

**Why it works:** Nothing demands immediate attention. The eye can rest. Space implies possibility.

**Variations:**
- Single element + vast void: isolation, significance
- Few scattered elements: universe, constellation
- Void with subtle variation: atmosphere, presence

---

### Grounded Stability

```
heavy_element + bottom_position + anchored + horizontal_base
→ Creates: security, permanence, foundation
```

**Why it works:** Weight at bottom = stable. Mimics gravity, architecture, nature.

**Variations:**
- Wide base: maximum stability
- Narrow base: precarious stability, ready to fall
- Floating base: surreal, dreamlike

---

## 4.4 Movement Patterns

Patterns that create implied motion.

---

### Flowing Movement

```
curved_lines + continuation + rhythm + soft_boundaries
→ Creates: grace, organic motion, music, water
```

**Why it works:** Curves have no stops. The eye follows continuously. Rhythm creates temporal experience.

**Variations:**
- Single curve: simple flow, gesture
- Interlocking curves: complexity, weaving
- Spiral: depth, hypnosis, cosmos

---

### Directional Movement

```
diagonal_elements + parallel_alignment + convergence + speed_variation
→ Creates: journey, progress, narrative, wind
```

**Why it works:** Parallel diagonals create unified direction. Variation in "speed" (spacing, size) adds interest.

**Variations:**
- Accelerating (closer spacing): building energy
- Decelerating (wider spacing): slowing, ending
- Constant (even spacing): steady, mechanical

---

### Spiral Movement

```
curved_path + decreasing_scale + center_focus + rotation
→ Creates: depth, hypnosis, vortex, journey inward
```

**Why it works:** Spiral leads inward inevitably. Scale change creates depth. Rotation creates energy.

**Variations:**
- Tight spiral: intense, rapid
- Loose spiral: gentle, cosmic
- Spiral outward: expansion, explosion, creation

---

### Scattered Movement

```
multiple_points + random_distribution + varied_scale + divergence
→ Creates: explosion, chaos, freedom, stars
```

**Why it works:** No unified direction. Everything moves independently. Maximum entropy.

**Variations:**
- Dense scatter: explosion, burst
- Sparse scatter: cosmos, solitude
- Scatter with faint convergence: formation, gathering

---

## 4.5 Emotional Patterns

Patterns that evoke specific feelings.

---

### Intimacy

```
close_proximity + soft_boundaries + warm_temperature + personal_distance
→ Creates: connection, tenderness, vulnerability, love
```

**Elements:** Two forms nearly touching or overlapping, soft edges, warm colors, close to viewer.

---

### Isolation

```
single_element + surrounding_void + cold_temperature + public_distance
→ Creates: loneliness, independence, contemplation, exposure
```

**Elements:** One form in vast space, cool colors, distant from viewer.

---

### Mystery

```
partial_visibility + dissolved_boundaries + low_contrast + deep_space
→ Creates: curiosity, uncertainty, invitation, fog
```

**Elements:** Forms half-hidden, edges lost, depth unclear, something beyond.

---

### Overwhelm

```
multiple_elements + high_density + frame_filling + extreme_contrast
→ Creates: chaos, intensity, sensory overload, noise
```

**Elements:** Too much to take in, no rest for eye, everything competing.

---

### Dissolution

```
soft_boundaries + gradual_transition + fading_contrast + void_merging
→ Creates: transformation, impermanence, transcendence, death/birth
```

**Elements:** Forms losing definition, becoming void, process of change.

---

### Emergence

```
void_dominant + single_element + sharp_boundary + high_contrast
→ Creates: birth, appearance, significance, creation
```

**Elements:** Something coming from nothing, clarity against emptiness.

---

## 4.6 Narrative Patterns

Patterns that imply time and story.

---

### Before (Anticipation)

```
potential_movement + static_position + direction_implied + edge_tension
→ Creates: anticipation, suspense, beginning, potential
```

**Elements:** Something about to happen. Forces gathered but unreleased.

---

### During (Action)

```
frozen_movement + diagonal_elements + blur_suggestion + high_energy
→ Creates: action, present moment, drama, peak
```

**Elements:** Moment captured mid-action. Maximum kinetic energy.

---

### After (Aftermath)

```
resolved_tension + horizontal_rest + scattered_elements + low_energy
→ Creates: conclusion, aftermath, reflection, ending
```

**Elements:** Energy spent. Things at rest. Evidence of what happened.

---

### Threshold (Transition)

```
two_zones + boundary_between + element_crossing + contrast_shift
→ Creates: transition, choice, passage, transformation
```

**Elements:** Two different spaces. Something moving between them.

---

## 4.7 Compositional Archetypes

Classic structures that appear across art history.

---

### The Gateway

```
two_vertical_elements + space_between + depth_beyond + convergent_lines
→ Invites entry, promises revelation, frames destination
```

---

### The Pyramid

```
broad_base + converging_sides + apex_focus + stable_foundation
→ Hierarchy, authority, stability, aspiration
```

---

### The Cross

```
vertical_element + horizontal_element + intersection_focus
→ Balance, meeting point, stillness, sacred
```

---

### The Radial

```
center_element + emanating_lines + equal_distribution
→ Explosion or implosion, power, sun, centrality
```

---

### The Grid

```
repeated_elements + regular_intervals + uniform_properties
→ Order, system, multiplicity, industrial
```

---

### The Cascade

```
elements + diagonal_arrangement + decreasing_scale + overlapping
→ Flow, abundance, descent, waterfall
```

---

### The Spiral

```
curved_path + changing_scale + rotation + depth
→ Journey, infinity, growth, cosmos
```

---

## Using Patterns

### Analysis Mode

1. Look at a composition
2. Identify which patterns are present
3. Note how they combine or conflict
4. Explain why it creates its feeling

### Generation Mode

1. Decide what feeling you want
2. Select appropriate patterns
3. Choose elements, properties, relations
4. Create the composition
5. Evaluate: did it work? Why or why not?

### Breaking Patterns

Every pattern can be inverted:
- Isolation Focus → Overwhelming Density
- Diagonal Drama → Horizontal Rest
- Intimacy → Isolation

Or combined with its opposite for complexity:
- Calm center + tense edges
- Focus element + chaotic surroundings
- Intimate distance + cold temperature

## Practice

### Exercise 1: Pattern Recognition

Find three images. For each, identify:
- Which patterns are present?
- Which is dominant?
- How do patterns interact?

### Exercise 2: Pattern Generation

Choose a feeling. Create three compositions using three different patterns that all create that feeling. Which works best? Why?

### Exercise 3: Pattern Breaking

Take a familiar pattern. Break it deliberately. What happens to the feeling?

### Exercise 4: Pattern Combination

Combine two opposing patterns in one composition. How do you balance them? What new feeling emerges?
